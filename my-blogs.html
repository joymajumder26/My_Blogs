    <p class="">Alutila cave and Sajek Valley are both wildly popular tourist spots in Khagrachari. The Alutila cave can be crossed in about twenty minutes. Thrill-seekers will enjoy the adventure through the rugged clay rocks and icy cold waters.Sajek Valley, too, is compact, but utterly beautiful. There are plenty of resorts and restaurants dotted on both sides of a single-track road. Since the valley is at a very high altitude, some people even get to actually touch clouds!

        Sajek also has a small hill called Konglak, which is popular among hikers. The entire Sajek can be seen in two days, making it an ideal day or weekend trip.
